ABOUT USPCG MINISTRY exists to spread a passion for the supremacy of God in all things for the joy of all peoples through Jesus Christ.
Thank you so much for remembering our fathers who taught us the gospel,
who taught us salvation, who taught us to pray and read the Bible, and who set an example for the Lord in life. Thank you very much, I respect you.
